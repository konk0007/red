# Fairy tales

Added a background colour and image at script.js to make the HTML page more interesting.
Created the img folder for the image

```
document.body.style.backgroundColor = '#f3f3f3'
document.body.style.backgroundImage = "url('img/tale.PNG')"
document.body.style.backgroundRepeat = 'no-repeat'

```


#### CSS style snippet  was included in index.html ..

```
<style>
h1{
color: #0988FF;
font-weight: 600;
text-align: center;
}
</style>

```
#### In Part 2 of Snow White I typed "... the eight dwarfs."  instead of  "... the seven dwarfs" to keep logical consistency.
